<!-- Brief introduction. -->
During a security assessment for a client, the security testers determined that the client was utilizing FME Server version 2022.1.1. The testers uncovered that this particular version was susceptible to a Directory Traversal/File Inclusion vulnerability, which results in the unauthorized reading and writing of arbitrary files. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would require access to a user account with at least write privileges.

## Proof of Concept
<!-- In Depth discussion of the vulnerability. Whats it's impact, show enough proof but not too much. DO NOT INCLUDE EXPLOIT PAYLOADS! -->
FME Server offers the capability to integrate various resources, including network-based resources. FME Server checks if a given path for a network-based resource refers to a network-based resource by verifying the string's format. If the string does not begin with \\ the validation fails, and the resource cannot be saved. However, if a valid network path is initially provided, and the resource is later edited, the validation will allow any path, including paths from the local file system.
